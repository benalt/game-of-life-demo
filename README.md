# game-of-life-demo

This is a simple implementation of the Game of Life Simulation. 

This implementation uses NodeJS, with no additional packages. It requires node 18.7, as it uses some experimental features like the fetch API (which is added in earlier versions in node packages.)

Running this successfully will result in the terminal opening a browser with a visualization of the multi-generational world.

# To Run
```
node app.js
```
